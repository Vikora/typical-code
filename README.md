# Concurrency and Parallelism in Python

**Concurrency** 
* Two or more tasks are running in overlapping periods on a single processor and core.

**Parallelism**
* Multiple tasks or distributed parts of a task run independently and simultaneously on multiple processors.

Imagine two queues of customers. Concurrency means a single cashier serves customers by switching between two queues.
Parallelism means two cashiers simultaneously serve the two queues of customers.

**Process**
has its own address space, memory, data stack.

**Thread**
executes within its process and share the same context.
